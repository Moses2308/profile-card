## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project allowed me to practice more with absolute and relative positioning. Additionally, it taught me how borders interact with an elent when padding and margin are added.
The project also taught me about how to use background-size, background-image, and background-repeat.

### Continued development

I want to continue putting the background properties into practice so that I can become comfortable and proficient with using them. I would also like to dive deeper into other css units like VH and VW.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This resource helped me learn about the specifics of each property and how to use them.
- [Mr Coder](https://www.youtube.com/@MrCoderYt) - His video covering this challenge had an approach I related to the most. His video gave me new perspective on when to use vw and vh units.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Mr Coder for his video on this challenge. Without his perspective, I would've been unable to reach a solution for the background I found satisfactory.
